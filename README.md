# Advanced Calculator

Welcome to the **Advanced Calculator**! This Python-based project offers both a graphical user interface (GUI) calculator and a terminal-based version. It is designed to provide a flexible and powerful tool for basic and advanced mathematical operations.

## Features

- **GUI Version**:
  - Built with PyQt for a modern and interactive user experience.
  - Supports basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical functions, and graphic calculations.
  - Ability to visualize mathematical functions such as waveforms, trigonometric plots, and more.
- **Terminal Version**:
  - Lightweight and ideal for testing purposes.
  - Performs the same operations as the GUI version via command-line input.
- **Extensive Testing**:
  - Includes multiple test files to ensure functionality and correctness.
- **Easily Extensible**:
  - Modular code structure allows for adding more features and operations.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher** is required. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **PyQt5** (for the GUI version). Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install PyQt5
- **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ThenerzZ/advanced_calculator.git
  cd advanced_calculator
  
- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- **GUI Version (Recommended)**
  - To launch the GUI version of the calculator:
    ```bash
    python gui_calculator_qt.py
- **Terminal Version (For Testing)**
  - To use the terminal-based calculator:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
- **Testing**
  - The project includes several test files to verify the correctness of the calculatorâ€™s functionality. To run the tests:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests/
